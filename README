This is my first decent sized coding project.  I used it to learn Java, Android development and programming in general.
When I started this project I knew almost nothing about coding and every step of the project was a learning experience.
Because of this, the code is a bit messy but I am slowly refactoring areas to be cleaner and structured in a better way.
